[3]        
[4]        
[5]        STATELY, PLUMP BUCK MULLIGAN CAME FROM THE STAIRHEAD, bearing a bowl of 
[6]        lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown, 
[7]        ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him by the mild morning air. He 
[8]        held the bowl aloft and intoned: 
[9]        
[10]       --INTROIBO AD ALTARE DEI. 
[11]       
[12]       Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: 
[13]       
[14]       --Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit! 
[15]       
[16]       Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about 
[17]       and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the 
[18]       awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent 
[19]       towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and 
[20]       shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms 
[21]       on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling 
[22]       face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured 
[23]       hair, grained and hued like pale oak. 
[24]       
[25]       Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered 
[26]       the bowl smartly. 
[27]       
[28]       --Back to barracks! he said sternly. 
[29]       
[30]       He added in a preacher's tone: 
[31]       
[32]       --For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and 
[33]       blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A 
[34]       little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all. 
[35]       
[36]       He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused 
[37]       awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there 
[38]       with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered 
[39]       through the calm. 
[40]       
[41]       --Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off the 
[42]       current, will you? 
[43]       
[44]       He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering 
[45]       about his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and 
[46]       sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A 
[47]       pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips. 
[48]       
[49]       --The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! 
[50]       
[51]       He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, 
[52]       laughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily 
[53]       halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he 
[54]       propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and 
[55]       lathered cheeks and neck. 
[56]       
[57]       Buck Mulligan's gay voice went on. 
[58]       
[59]       --My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a 
[60]       Hellenic ring, hasn't it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We 
[61]       must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty 
[62]       quid? 
[63]       
[64]       He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: 
[65]       
[66]       --Will he come? The jejune jesuit! 
[67]       
[68]       Ceasing, he began to shave with care. 
[69]       
[70]       --Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly. 
[71]       
[72]       --Yes, my love? 
[73]       
[74]       --How long is Haines going to stay in this tower? 
[75]       
[76]       Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder. 
[77]       
[78]       --God, isn't he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks 
[79]       you're not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money 
[80]       and indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you 
[81]       have the real Oxford manner. He can't make you out. O, my name for you is 
[82]       the best: Kinch, the knife-blade. 
[83]       
[84]       He shaved warily over his chin. 
[85]       
[86]       --He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is 
[87]       his guncase? 
[88]       
[89]       --A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk? 
[90]       
[91]       --I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark 
[92]       with a man I don't know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a 
[93]       black panther. You saved men from drowning. I'm not a hero, however. If 
[94]       he stays on here I am off. 
[95]       
[96]       Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down 
[97]       from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily. 
[98]       
[99]       --Scutter! he cried thickly. 
[100]      
[101]      He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen's upper 
[102]      pocket, said: 
[103]      
[104]      --Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor. 
[105]      
[106]      Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a 
[107]      dirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. 
[108]      Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: 
[109]      
[110]      --The bard's noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen. 
[111]      You can almost taste it, can't you? 
[112]      
[113]      He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair 
[114]      oakpale hair stirring slightly. 
[115]      
[116]      --God! he said quietly. Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet 
[117]      mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. EPI OINOPA PONTON. 
[118]      Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in the 
[119]      original. THALATTA! THALATTA! She is our great sweet mother. Come and 
[120]      look. 
[121]      
[122]      Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked 
[123]      down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of 
[124]      Kingstown. 
[125]      
[126]      --Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said. 
[127]      
[128]      He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's 
[129]      face. 
[130]      
[131]      --The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she won't 
[132]      let me have anything to do with you. 
[133]      
[134]      --Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily. 
[135]      
[136]      --You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked 
[137]      you, Buck Mulligan said. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to think of 
[138]      your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for 
[139]      her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you ... 
[140]      
[141]      He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant 
[142]      smile curled his lips. 
[143]      
[144]      --But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest 
[145]      mummer of them all! 
[146]      
[147]      He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously. 
[148]      
[149]      Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against 
[150]      his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve. 
[151]      Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in 
[152]      a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its 
[153]      loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her 
[154]      breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of 
[155]      wetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a 
[156]      great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and 
[157]      skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had stood 
[158]      beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up 
[159]      from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting. 
[160]      
[161]      Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade. 
[162]      
[163]      --Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt and 
[164]      a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks? 
[165]      
[166]      --They fit well enough, Stephen answered. 
[167]      
[168]      Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip. 
[169]      
[170]      --The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God 
[171]      knows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair 
[172]      stripe, grey. You'll look spiffing in them. I'm not joking, Kinch. You 
[173]      look damn well when you're dressed. 
[174]      
[175]      --Thanks, Stephen said. I can't wear them if they are grey. 
[176]      
[177]      --He can't wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror. 
[178]      Etiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can't wear grey 
[179]      trousers. 
[180]      
[181]      He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the 
[182]      smooth skin. 
[183]      
[184]      Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its 
[185]      smokeblue mobile eyes. 
[186]      
[187]      --That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says 
[188]      you have g.p.i. He's up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General 
[189]      paralysis of the insane! 
[190]      
[191]      He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad 
[192]      in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and 
[193]      the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong 
[194]      wellknit trunk. 
[195]      
[196]      --Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! 
[197]      
[198]      Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a 
[199]      crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this face 
[200]      for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too. 
[201]      
[202]      --I pinched it out of the skivvy's room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her 
[203]      all right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead 
[204]      him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula. 
[205]      
[206]      Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen's peering eyes. 
[207]      
[208]      --The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If 
[209]      Wilde were only alive to see you! 
[210]      
[211]      Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: 
[212]      
[213]      --It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked looking-glass of a servant. 
[214]      
[215]      Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen's and walked with him 
[216]      round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had 
[217]      thrust them. 
[218]      
[219]      --It's not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly. God 
[220]      knows you have more spirit than any of them. 
[221]      
[222]      Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The 
[223]      cold steelpen. 
[224]      
[225]      --Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs 
[226]      and touch him for a guinea. He's stinking with money and thinks you're 
[227]      not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or 
[228]      some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only work 
[229]      together we might do something for the island. Hellenise it. 
[230]      
[231]      Cranly's arm. His arm. 
[232]      
[233]      --And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I'm the only one 
[234]      that knows what you are. Why don't you trust me more? What have you up 
[235]      your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I'll bring 
[236]      down Seymour and we'll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive 
[237]      Kempthorpe. 
[238]      
[239]      Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe's rooms. Palefaces: 
[240]      they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall 
[241]      expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit 
[242]      ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the 
[243]      table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the 
[244]      tailor's shears. A scared calf's face gilded with marmalade. I don't want 
[245]      to be debagged! Don't you play the giddy ox with me! 
[246]      
[247]      Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf 
[248]      gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold's face, pushes his mower on 
[249]      the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms. 
[250]      
[251]      To ourselves ... new paganism ... omphalos. 
[252]      
[253]      --Let him stay, Stephen said. There's nothing wrong with him except at 
[254]      night. 
[255]      
[256]      --Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I'm 
[257]      quite frank with you. What have you against me now? 
[258]      
[259]      They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the 
[260]      water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly. 
[261]      
[262]      --Do you wish me to tell you? he asked. 
[263]      
[264]      --Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don't remember anything. 
[265]      
[266]      He looked in Stephen's face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow, 
[267]      fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of 
[268]      anxiety in his eyes. 
[269]      
[270]      Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: 
[271]      
[272]      --Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother's 
[273]      death? 
[274]      
[275]      Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: 
[276]      
[277]      --What? Where? I can't remember anything. I remember only ideas and 
[278]      sensations. Why? What happened in the name of God? 
[279]      
[280]      --You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get 
[281]      more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom. 
[282]      She asked you who was in your room. 
[283]      
[284]      --Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget. 
[285]      
[286]      --You said, Stephen answered, O, IT'S ONLY DEDALUS WHOSE MOTHER IS 
[287]      BEASTLY DEAD. 
[288]      
[289]      A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck 
[290]      Mulligan's cheek. 
[291]      
[292]      --Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that? 
[293]      
[294]      He shook his constraint from him nervously. 
[295]      
[296]      --And what is death, he asked, your mother's or yours or my own? You saw 
[297]      only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and 
[298]      Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It's a beastly 
[299]      thing and nothing else. It simply doesn't matter. You wouldn't kneel down 
[300]      to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Because 
[301]      you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it's injected the wrong 
[302]      way. To me it's all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are not 
[303]      functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups 
[304]      off the quilt. Humour her till it's over. You crossed her last wish in 
[305]      death and yet you sulk with me because I don't whinge like some hired 
[306]      mute from Lalouette's. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didn't mean to 
[307]      offend the memory of your mother. 
[308]      
[309]      He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds 
[310]      which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: 
[311]      
[312]      --I am not thinking of the offence to my mother. 
[313]      
[314]      --Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked. 
[315]      
[316]      --Of the offence to me, Stephen answered. 
[317]      
[318]      Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel. 
[319]      
[320]      --O, an impossible person! he exclaimed. 
[321]      
[322]      He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post, 
[323]      gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew 
[324]      dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt 
[325]      the fever of his cheeks. 
[326]      
[327]      A voice within the tower called loudly: 
[328]      
[329]      --Are you up there, Mulligan? 
[330]      
[331]      --I'm coming, Buck Mulligan answered. 
[332]      
[333]      He turned towards Stephen and said: 
[334]      
[335]      --Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch, 
[336]      and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers. 
[337]      
[338]      His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level 
[339]      with the roof: 
[340]      
[341]      --Don't mope over it all day, he said. I'm inconsequent. Give up the 
[342]      moody brooding. 
[343]      
[344]      His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the 
[345]      stairhead: 
[346]      
[347]      
[348]          AND NO MORE TURN ASIDE AND BROOD 
[349]         UPON LOVE'S BITTER MYSTERY 
[350]         FOR FERGUS RULES THE BRAZEN CARS. 
[351]      
[352]      
[353]      Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the 
[354]      stairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of 
[355]      water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the 
[356]      dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the 
[357]      harpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words 
[358]      shimmering on the dim tide. 
[359]      
[360]      A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in 
[361]      deeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus' song: 
[362]      I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her door 
[363]      was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity I went to 
[364]      her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those words, 
[365]      Stephen: love's bitter mystery. 
[366]      
[367]      Where now? 
[368]      
[369]      Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a 
[370]      gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny 
[371]      window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the 
[372]      pantomime of TURKO THE TERRIBLE and laughed with others when he sang: 
[373]      
[374]      
[375]          I AM THE BOY 
[376]          THAT CAN ENJOY 
[377]          INVISIBILITY. 
[378]      
[379]      
[380]      Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed. 
[381]      
[382]      
[383]          AND NO MORE TURN ASIDE AND BROOD. 
[384]      
[385]      
[386]      Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his 
[387]      brooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had 
[388]      approached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, 
[389]      roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely 
[390]      fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children's 
[391]      shirts. 
[392]      
[393]      In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its 
[394]      loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, 
[395]      bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes. 
[396]      
[397]      Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me 
[398]      alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured 
[399]      face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on 
[400]      their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. LILIATA RUTILANTIUM TE 
[401]      CONFESSORUM TURMA CIRCUMDET: IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM CHORUS EXCIPIAT. 
[402]      
[403]      Ghoul! Chewer of corpses! 
[404]      
[405]      No, mother! Let me be and let me live. 
[406]      
[407]      --Kinch ahoy! 
[408]      
[409]      Buck Mulligan's voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the 
[410]      staircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul's cry, 
[411]      heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words. 
[412]      
[413]      --Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is 
[414]      apologising for waking us last night. It's all right. 
[415]      
[416]      --I'm coming, Stephen said, turning. 
[417]      
[418]      --Do, for Jesus' sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our 
[419]      sakes. 
[420]      
[421]      His head disappeared and reappeared. 
[422]      
[423]      --I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it's very clever. Touch 
[424]      him for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean. 
[425]      
[426]      --I get paid this morning, Stephen said. 
[427]      
[428]      --The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one. 
[429]      
[430]      --If you want it, Stephen said. 
[431]      
[432]      --Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We'll have a 
[433]      glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent sovereigns. 
[434]      
[435]      He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of 
[436]      tune with a Cockney accent: 
[437]      
[438]      
[439]          O, WON'T WE HAVE A MERRY TIME, 
[440]          DRINKING WHISKY, BEER AND WINE! 
[441]          ON CORONATION, 
[442]          CORONATION DAY! 
[443]          O, WON'T WE HAVE A MERRY TIME 
[444]          ON CORONATION DAY! 
[445]      
[446]      
[447]      Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone, 
[448]      forgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there 
[449]      all day, forgotten friendship? 
[450]      
[451]      He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, 
[452]      smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. So 
[453]      I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yet 
[454]      the same. A servant too. A server of a servant. 
[455]      
[456]      In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan's gowned form 
[457]      moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its 
[458]      yellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor 
[459]      from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of 
[460]      coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning. 
[461]      
[462]      --We'll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you? 
[463]      
[464]      Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the 
[465]      hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open 
[466]      the inner doors. 
[467]      
[468]      --Have you the key? a voice asked. 
[469]      
[470]      --Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I'm choked! 
[471]      
[472]      He howled, without looking up from the fire: 
[473]      
[474]      --Kinch! 
[475]      
[476]      --It's in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward. 
[477]      
[478]      The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set 
[479]      ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the doorway, 
[480]      looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down 
[481]      to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Then he 
[482]      carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down 
[483]      heavily and sighed with relief. 
[484]      
[485]      --I'm melting, he said, as the candle remarked when ... But, hush! Not a 
[486]      word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines, 
[487]      come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. 
[488]      Where's the sugar? O, jay, there's no milk. 
[489]      
[490]      Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from 
[491]      the locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet. 
[492]      
[493]      --What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight. 
[494]      
[495]      --We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There's a lemon in the 
[496]      locker. 
[497]      
[498]      --O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove 
[499]      milk. 
[500]      
[501]      Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: 
[502]      
[503]      --That woman is coming up with the milk. 
[504]      
[505]      --The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his 
[506]      chair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, I 
[507]      can't go fumbling at the damned eggs. 
[508]      
[509]      He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, 
[510]      saying: 
[511]      
[512]      --IN NOMINE PATRIS ET FILII ET SPIRITUS SANCTI. 
[513]      
[514]      Haines sat down to pour out the tea. 
[515]      
[516]      --I'm giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do 
[517]      make strong tea, don't you? 
[518]      
[519]      Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman's 
[520]      wheedling voice: 
[521]      
[522]      --When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I 
[523]      makes water I makes water. 
[524]      
[525]      --By Jove, it is tea, Haines said. 
[526]      
[527]      Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: 
[528]      
[529]      --SO I DO, MRS CAHILL, says she. BEGOB, MA'AM, says Mrs Cahill, GOD SEND 
[530]      YOU DON'T MAKE THEM IN THE ONE POT. 
[531]      
[532]      He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled 
[533]      on his knife. 
[534]      
[535]      --That's folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines 
[536]      of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of 
[537]      Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind. 
[538]      
[539]      He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his 
[540]      brows: 
[541]      
[542]      --Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan's tea and water pot spoken of 
[543]      in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads? 
[544]      
[545]      --I doubt it, said Stephen gravely. 
[546]      
[547]      --Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray? 
[548]      
[549]      --I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the 
[550]      Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann. 
[551]      
[552]      Buck Mulligan's face smiled with delight. 
[553]      
[554]      --Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and 
[555]      blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming! 
[556]      
[557]      Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened 
[558]      rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: 
[559]      
[560]      
[561]        --FOR OLD MARY ANN 
[562]          SHE DOESN'T CARE A DAMN. 
[563]          BUT, HISING UP HER PETTICOATS ... 
[564]      
[565]      
[566]      He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned. 
[567]      
[568]      The doorway was darkened by an entering form. 
[569]      
[570]      --The milk, sir! 
[571]      
[572]      --Come in, ma'am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug. 
[573]      
[574]      An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen's elbow. 
[575]      
[576]      --That's a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God. 
[577]      
[578]      --To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure! 
[579]      
[580]      Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker. 
[581]      
[582]      --The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of 
[583]      the collector of prepuces. 
[584]      
[585]      --How much, sir? asked the old woman. 
[586]      
[587]      --A quart, Stephen said. 
[588]      
[589]      He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white 
[590]      milk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a 
[591]      tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a 
[592]      messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. 
[593]      Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her 
[594]      toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed 
[595]      about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old 
[596]      woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of an 
[597]      immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common 
[598]      cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid, 
[599]      whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour. 
[600]      
[601]      --It is indeed, ma'am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups. 
[602]      
[603]      --Taste it, sir, she said. 
[604]      
[605]      He drank at her bidding. 
[606]      
[607]      --If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat 
[608]      loudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten 
[609]      guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with 
[610]      dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits. 
[611]      
[612]      --Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked. 
[613]      
[614]      --I am, ma'am, Buck Mulligan answered. 
[615]      
[616]      --Look at that now, she said. 
[617]      
[618]      Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice 
[619]      that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she 
[620]      slights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is 
[621]      of her but her woman's unclean loins, of man's flesh made not in God's 
[622]      likeness, the serpent's prey. And to the loud voice that now bids her be 
[623]      silent with wondering unsteady eyes. 
[624]      
[625]      --Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her. 
[626]      
[627]      --Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines. 
[628]      
[629]      Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently. 
[630]      
[631]      --Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you? 
[632]      
[633]      --I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the 
[634]      west, sir? 
[635]      
[636]      --I am an Englishman, Haines answered. 
[637]      
[638]      --He's English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish 
[639]      in Ireland. 
[640]      
[641]      --Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I'm ashamed I don't speak the 
[642]      language myself. I'm told it's a grand language by them that knows. 
[643]      
[644]      --Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill 
[645]      us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma'am? 
[646]      
[647]      --No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the 
[648]      milkcan on her forearm and about to go. 
[649]      
[650]      Haines said to her: 
[651]      
[652]      --Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn't we? 
[653]      
[654]      Stephen filled again the three cups. 
[655]      
[656]      --Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it's seven mornings a pint at 
[657]      twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three 
[658]      mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That's a 
[659]      shilling and one and two is two and two, sir. 
[660]      
[661]      Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly 
[662]      buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his 
[663]      trouser pockets. 
[664]      
[665]      --Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling. 
[666]      
[667]      Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick 
[668]      rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his 
[669]      fingers and cried: 
[670]      
[671]      --A miracle! 
[672]      
[673]      He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: 
[674]      
[675]      --Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give. 
[676]      
[677]      Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand. 
[678]      
[679]      --We'll owe twopence, he said. 
[680]      
[681]      --Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning, 
[682]      sir. 
[683]      
[684]      She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan's tender chant: 
[685]      
[686]      
[687]        --HEART OF MY HEART, WERE IT MORE, 
[688]          MORE WOULD BE LAID AT YOUR FEET. 
[689]      
[690]      
[691]      He turned to Stephen and said: 
[692]      
[693]      --Seriously, Dedalus. I'm stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring 
[694]      us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland 
[695]      expects that every man this day will do his duty. 
[696]      
[697]      --That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your 
[698]      national library today. 
[699]      
[700]      --Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said. 
[701]      
[702]      He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: 
[703]      
[704]      --Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch? 
[705]      
[706]      Then he said to Haines: 
[707]      
[708]      --The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month. 
[709]      
[710]      --All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey 
[711]      trickle over a slice of the loaf. 
[712]      
[713]      Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the 
[714]      loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: 
[715]      
[716]      --I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me. 
[717]      
[718]      Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit. 
[719]      Conscience. Yet here's a spot. 
[720]      
[721]      --That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol 
[722]      of Irish art is deuced good. 
[723]      
[724]      Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen's foot under the table and said with warmth 
[725]      of tone: 
[726]      
[727]      --Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines. 
[728]      
[729]      --Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just 
[730]      thinking of it when that poor old creature came in. 
[731]      
[732]      --Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked. 
[733]      
[734]      Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the 
[735]      hammock, said: 
[736]      
[737]      --I don't know, I'm sure. 
[738]      
[739]      He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and 
[740]      said with coarse vigour: 
[741]      
[742]      --You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for? 
[743]      
[744]      --Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the 
[745]      milkwoman or from him. It's a toss up, I think. 
[746]      
[747]      --I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along 
[748]      with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes. 
[749]      
[750]      --I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him. 
[751]      
[752]      Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen's arm. 
[753]      
[754]      --From me, Kinch, he said. 
[755]      
[756]      In a suddenly changed tone he added: 
[757]      
[758]      --To tell you the God's truth I think you're right. Damn all else they 
[759]      are good for. Why don't you play them as I do? To hell with them all. Let 
[760]      us get out of the kip. 
[761]      
[762]      He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying 
[763]      resignedly: 
[764]      
[765]      --Mulligan is stripped of his garments. 
[766]      
[767]      He emptied his pockets on to the table. 
[768]      
[769]      --There's your snotrag, he said. 
[770]      
[771]      And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, 
[772]      chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and 
[773]      rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God, 
[774]      we'll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green 
[775]      boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I 
[776]      contradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of 
[777]      his talking hands. 
[778]      
[779]      --And there's your Latin quarter hat, he said. 
[780]      
[781]      Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the 
[782]      doorway: 
[783]      
[784]      --Are you coming, you fellows? 
[785]      
[786]      --I'm ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out, 
[787]      Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out with 
[788]      grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: 
[789]      
[790]      --And going forth he met Butterly. 
[791]      
[792]      Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out 
[793]      and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and 
[794]      locked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket. 
[795]      
[796]      At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: 
[797]      
[798]      --Did you bring the key? 
[799]      
[800]      --I have it, Stephen said, preceding them. 
[801]      
[802]      He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy 
[803]      bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses. 
[804]      
[805]      --Down, sir! How dare you, sir! 
[806]      
[807]      Haines asked: 
[808]      
[809]      --Do you pay rent for this tower? 
[810]      
[811]      --Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said. 
[812]      
[813]      --To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder. 
[814]      
[815]      They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: 
[816]      
[817]      --Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it? 
[818]      
[819]      --Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on 
[820]      the sea. But ours is the OMPHALOS. 
[821]      
[822]      --What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen. 
[823]      
[824]      --No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I'm not equal to Thomas Aquinas 
[825]      and the fifty-five reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I have 
[826]      a few pints in me first. 
[827]      
[828]      He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his 
[829]      primrose waistcoat: 
[830]      
[831]      --You couldn't manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you? 
[832]      
[833]      --It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer. 
[834]      
[835]      --You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox? 
[836]      
[837]      --Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. 
[838]      It's quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is 
[839]      Shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own 
[840]      father. 
[841]      
[842]      --What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself? 
[843]      
[844]      Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in 
[845]      loose laughter, said to Stephen's ear: 
[846]      
[847]      --O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father! 
[848]      
[849]      --We're always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is 
[850]      rather long to tell. 
[851]      
[852]      Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands. 
[853]      
[854]      --The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said. 
[855]      
[856]      --I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower 
[857]      and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. THAT BEETLES O'ER 
[858]      HIS BASE INTO THE SEA, ISN'T IT? 
[859]      
[860]      Buck Mulligan turned suddenly. for an instant towards Stephen but did not 
[861]      speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap 
[862]      dusty mourning between their gay attires. 
[863]      
[864]      --It's a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again. 
[865]      
[866]      Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. 
[867]      The seas' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the 
[868]      smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking 
[869]      by the Muglins. 
[870]      
[871]      --I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused. 
[872]      The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the 
[873]      Father. 
[874]      
[875]      Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at 
[876]      them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had 
[877]      suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a 
[878]      doll's head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began 
[879]      to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: 
[880]      
[881]      
[882]        --I'M THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD. 
[883]          MY MOTHER'S A JEW, MY FATHER'S A BIRD. 
[884]          WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE. 
[885]          SO HERE'S TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARY. 
[886]      
[887]      
[888]      He held up a forefinger of warning. 
[889]      
[890]      
[891]        --IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMN'T DIVINE 
[892]          HE'LL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN I'M MAKING THE WINE 
[893]          BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN 
[894]          THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAIN. 
[895]      
[896]      
[897]      He tugged swiftly at Stephen's ashplant in farewell and, running forward 
[898]      to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or 
[899]      wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: 
[900]      
[901]      
[902]        --GOODBYE, NOW, GOODBYE! WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID 
[903]          AND TELL TOM, DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD. 
[904]          WHAT'S BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY 
[905]          AND OLIVET'S BREEZY ... GOODBYE, NOW, GOODBYE! 
[906]      
[907]      
[908]      He capered before them down towards the forty-foot hole, fluttering his 
[909]      winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury's hat quivering in the fresh wind 
[910]      that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries. 
[911]      
[912]      Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and 
[913]      said: 
[914]      
[915]      --We oughtn't to laugh, I suppose. He's rather blasphemous. I'm not a 
[916]      believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of 
[917]      it somehow, doesn't it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner? 
[918]      
[919]      --The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered. 
[920]      
[921]      --O, Haines said, you have heard it before? 
[922]      
[923]      --Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily. 
[924]      
[925]      --You're not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in the 
[926]      narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a 
[927]      personal God. 
[928]      
[929]      --There's only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said. 
[930]      
[931]      Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green 
[932]      stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it. 
[933]      
[934]      --Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette. 
[935]      
[936]      Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his 
[937]      sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang 
[938]      it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk 
[939]      towards Stephen in the shell of his hands. 
[940]      
[941]      --Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or 
[942]      you don't, isn't it? Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a 
[943]      personal God. You don't stand for that, I suppose? 
[944]      
[945]      --You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible 
[946]      example of free thought. 
[947]      
[948]      He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side. 
[949]      Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. My 
[950]      familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along 
[951]      the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. He wants 
[952]      that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him 
[953]      the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his eyes. 
[954]      
[955]      --After all, Haines began ... 
[956]      
[957]      Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not 
[958]      all unkind. 
[959]      
[960]      --After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your 
[961]      own master, it seems to me. 
[962]      
[963]      --I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian. 
[964]      
[965]      --Italian? Haines said. 
[966]      
[967]      A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me. 
[968]      
[969]      --And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs. 
[970]      
[971]      --Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean? 
[972]      
[973]      --The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and 
[974]      the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church. 
[975]      
[976]      Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke. 
[977]      
[978]      --I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think 
[979]      like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather 
[980]      unfairly. It seems history is to blame. 
[981]      
[982]      The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen's memory the triumph of 
[983]      their brazen bells: ET UNAM SANCTAM CATHOLICAM ET APOSTOLICAM ECCLESIAM: 
[984]      the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, 
[985]      a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope 
[986]      Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and 
[987]      behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and 
[988]      menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: 
[989]      Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, 
[990]      warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the 
[991]      Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ's terrene body, and the subtle 
[992]      African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own 
[993]      Son. Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger. 
[994]      Idle mockery. The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a 
[995]      menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the 
[996]      church, Michael's host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with 
[997]      their lances and their shields. 
[998]      
[999]      Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. ZUT! NOM DE DIEU! 
[1000]     
[1001]     --Of course I'm a Britisher, Haines's voice said, and I feel as one. I 
[1002]     don't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. 
[1003]     That's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now. 
[1004]     
[1005]     Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman. 
[1006]     
[1007]     --She's making for Bullock harbour. 
[1008]     
[1009]     The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain. 
[1010]     
[1011]     --There's five fathoms out there, he said. It'll be swept up that way 
[1012]     when the tide comes in about one. It's nine days today. 
[1013]     
[1014]     The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for 
[1015]     a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite. 
[1016]     Here I am. 
[1017]     
[1018]     They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on 
[1019]     a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. A 
[1020]     young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his 
[1021]     green legs in the deep jelly of the water. 
[1022]     
[1023]     --Is the brother with you, Malachi? 
[1024]     
[1025]     --Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons. 
[1026]     
[1027]     --Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young 
[1028]     thing down there. Photo girl he calls her. 
[1029]     
[1030]     --Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure. 
[1031]     
[1032]     Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near 
[1033]     the spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones, water 
[1034]     glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling 
[1035]     over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging 
[1036]     loincloth. 
[1037]     
[1038]     Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines 
[1039]     and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips 
[1040]     and breastbone. 
[1041]     
[1042]     --Seymour's back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of 
[1043]     rock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army. 
[1044]     
[1045]     --Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said. 
[1046]     
[1047]     --Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily? 
[1048]     
[1049]     --Yes. 
[1050]     
[1051]     --Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with 
[1052]     money. 
[1053]     
[1054]     --Is she up the pole? 
[1055]     
[1056]     --Better ask Seymour that. 
[1057]     
[1058]     --Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said. 
[1059]     
[1060]     He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying 
[1061]     tritely: 
[1062]     
[1063]     --Redheaded women buck like goats. 
[1064]     
[1065]     He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt. 
[1066]     
[1067]     --My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I'm the UBERMENSCH. Toothless Kinch 
[1068]     and I, the supermen. 
[1069]     
[1070]     He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his 
[1071]     clothes lay. 
[1072]     
[1073]     --Are you going in here, Malachi? 
[1074]     
[1075]     --Yes. Make room in the bed. 
[1076]     
[1077]     The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the 
[1078]     middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a 
[1079]     stone, smoking. 
[1080]     
[1081]     --Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked. 
[1082]     
[1083]     --Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast. 
[1084]     
[1085]     Stephen turned away. 
[1086]     
[1087]     --I'm going, Mulligan, he said. 
[1088]     
[1089]     --Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat. 
[1090]     
[1091]     Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped 
[1092]     clothes. 
[1093]     
[1094]     --And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there. 
[1095]     
[1096]     Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck 
[1097]     Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: 
[1098]     
[1099]     --He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake 
[1100]     Zarathustra. 
[1101]     
[1102]     His plump body plunged. 
[1103]     
[1104]     --We'll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path 
[1105]     and smiling at wild Irish. 
[1106]     
[1107]     Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon. 
[1108]     
[1109]     --The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve. 
[1110]     
[1111]     --Good, Stephen said. 
[1112]     
[1113]     He walked along the upwardcurving path. 
[1114]     
[1115]     
[1116]         LILIATA RUTILANTIUM. 
[1117]         TURMA CIRCUMDET. 
[1118]         IUBILANTIUM TE VIRGINUM. 
[1119]     
[1120]     
[1121]     The priest's grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will 
[1122]     not sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.
